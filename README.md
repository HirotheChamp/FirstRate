## Background

I am a part of a music group known as Elevated Common Ground. We typically host events for music and I decided to make a website catered to event planning. Thus, Eventful was derived!

## Features

* Creating events
* booking events
* graph that formulates the cost of all the posted events

## Technologies Used

* React -- I decided to use React because of its popularity, making it a relatable library to use when developing an application
* MongoDB -- use to store data in the form of bugs and users created through the application
* Express -- enables connection to the frontend with minimal approach
* HTML, CSS, JSON -- used to create front end form creation script
* GraphQL -- Creating database schemas to be used in making single API calls
