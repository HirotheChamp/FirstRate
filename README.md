## Background

I wanted to start a project that stemmed from rating and commenting on anything possible. This may include: movies, food, services, etc. These comments and ratings would be tallied up and rendered as a score from 1-100.

## Features

* Login and Registration
* Creating listing



<hr></hr>

## Technologies Used

* React -- I decided to use React because of its popularity, making it a relatable library to use when developing an application
* MongoDB -- use to store data in the form of bugs and users created through the application
* Express -- enables connection to the frontend with minimal approach
* HTML, CSS, JSON -- used to create front end form creation script

Stream chat api is also being implemented for engagement between users.
